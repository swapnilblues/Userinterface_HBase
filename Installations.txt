•	Flask	
Let’s start by creating a virtual environment -
cd~
sudoapt-getinstallpython-virtualenv
sudoapt-getinstallpython-pip
To check if virtualenv is correctly installed, type -
virtualenv--version
At the time this post was written, the output was -
1.11.4
Now let’s make a directory flask-application where we will store our project.
mkdirflask-application
cdflask-application
It time to create to virtual environment flask-env, where we will install flask.
virtualenvflask-env
You will see the following output on the terminal -
Newpythonexecutableinflask-env/bin/python
Installingsetuptools,pip...done.
We have successfully created our virtual environment, now let’s activate it using the command below -
sourceflask-env/bin/activate
You will now notice that on left side of your command prompt, (flask-env) appears. So now, when you install a package, it will only be accessible from the virtual environment. When you exit the virtual environment, you can no longer access any package you install inside the virtual environment. It is time to install flask. We will use pip to install the package -  
pipinstallFlask
